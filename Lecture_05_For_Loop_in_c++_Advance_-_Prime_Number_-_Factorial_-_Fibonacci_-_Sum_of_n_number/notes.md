# Lecture 5: Advanced For Loop, Prime, Factorial, Fibonacci

This lecture explored advanced use cases of the `for` loop and applied them to solve common mathematical problems.

## For Loop Variations
- Printing number sequences in different patterns:
  - Forward (101 to 200).
  - Backward (reverse order).
  - With steps (difference of 3).
  - Alphabets from `a` to `z`.
- Generating multiplication tables.
- Calculating powers of a number using repeated multiplication.

## Problem Solving with Loops
- Sum of first `n` natural numbers.
- Sum of squares of first `n` natural numbers.
- Factorial calculation through iterative multiplication.

## Prime Numbers
- Learned the logic for checking if a number is prime:
  - Edge cases handled (`n <= 1`).
  - Efficient check up to âˆšn.

## Fibonacci Series
- Generated the Fibonacci sequence iteratively.
- Understood how previous two terms help in generating the next.

## Key Takeaways
- `for` loop can be adapted for counting, reverse iteration, and custom step sizes.
- Loops form the foundation for solving mathematical and logical problems in programming.
- Combining conditions with loops unlocks powerful problem-solving abilities.
