# Lecture 22: Binary Search (Theory + Code)

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction
Binary Search is a **searching algorithm** used to find the position of a target element in a **sorted array**.  
It works by repeatedly dividing the search range into halves.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Working Principle
1. Start with the middle element of the sorted array.
2. If the target matches the middle element â†’ return the index.
3. If the target is smaller â†’ search the left half.
4. If the target is larger â†’ search the right half.
5. Repeat until the element is found or the search range is empty.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example
Array: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]`  
Target: `10`

- Step 1: mid = 6 â†’ target > 6 â†’ search right half.  
- Step 2: mid = 10 â†’ target found at index 4.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Time & Space Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(1) (if middle element is the target)  
- **Worst Case:** O(log n)  
- **Average Case:** O(log n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for iterative, O(log n) for recursive  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Advantages
- Much faster than Linear Search for large datasets.  
- Time complexity grows logarithmically.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Disadvantages
- Requires the array to be **sorted**.  
- Not suitable for linked lists (since random access is not efficient).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Summary
- Binary Search reduces search space by half at each step.  
- Works only on **sorted arrays**.  
- Iterative method is more space-efficient than recursion.

## ðŸ”¹ Code Implementation
See `code.cpp` file for iterative and recursive approaches.
