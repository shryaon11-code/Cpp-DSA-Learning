# Lecture 6: Solve Any Pattern Problem (Part 1)

This lecture introduced the **concept of nested loops** and how they are used to solve pattern-based problems in programming.

## Key Concepts
- **Nested Loops**: Using one loop inside another to control rows and columns.
- Trick: Outer loop → rows, Inner loop → columns.
- Patterns are simply combinations of loops printing characters/numbers.

## Patterns Covered
1. **Solid Rectangle (Stars)** – printing fixed rows and columns of stars.
2. **Number Patterns**:
   - Repeated single number in a row.
   - Increasing numbers in sequence (row-wise).
   - Descending number sequence.
3. **Square Number Patterns** – ascending and descending forms.
4. **Alphabet Patterns**:
   - Printing alphabets in rows/columns.
   - Using ASCII values to generate letters.
   - Ascending alphabet pattern.

## Debugging
- Learned common mistakes in nested loops (extra spaces, incorrect row/column limits).
- Step-by-step dry run to verify logic.

## Key Takeaway
- Any **pattern problem** can be broken into:
  1. Identify rows (outer loop).
  2. Identify columns (inner loop).
  3. Decide **what to print** inside (stars, numbers, alphabets).
- With this trick, solving complex patterns becomes systematic.
