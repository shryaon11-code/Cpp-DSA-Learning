# Lecture 01: Introduction To Programming for Beginners

## 📌 Summary Notes
- Programming is a way to communicate with computers by giving them instructions.  
- Humans started with simple counting methods (stones, marks) → later developed number systems like decimal, octal, hexadecimal.  
- Computers work on **binary (0 & 1)** using transistors (ON/OFF states).  
- Conversion between number systems (decimal ↔ binary, octal, hexadecimal) is essential to understand how data is represented.  
- **Moore’s Law**: Computing power doubles roughly every 2 years due to transistor growth.  
- A computer only understands **machine language**, but we use high-level languages (like C++) for easier programming.  
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) are needed to write efficient programs and solve real-world problems effectively.

## 🖥️ First Program in C++
See `code.cpp` for a simple "Hello World" program.
