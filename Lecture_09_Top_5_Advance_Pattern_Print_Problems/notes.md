# Lecture 09: Top 5 Advanced Pattern Print Problems  

In this lecture, we explored some of the most common **advanced pattern problems** asked in interviews and coding practice.  
The focus was on applying **nested loops**, **space management**, and **mathematical logic** to build complex patterns efficiently.  

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Pyramid Patterns** – printing stars and numbers in pyramid/triangle format.  
2. **Diamond Pattern** – extending pyramid by combining upward and downward triangles.  
3. **Hollow Patterns** – using conditions (`if` inside loops) to leave spaces inside shapes.  
4. **Number-based Patterns** – printing incremental or symmetrical number structures.  
5. **Mixed Patterns** – combining stars, spaces, and numbers to form more creative outputs.  

These problems build upon the tricks learned in earlier lectures (6, 7, 8), especially **space handling** and **loop control**.  

By practicing these 5 patterns, one can solve most **advanced-level pattern problems** with minor modifications.
