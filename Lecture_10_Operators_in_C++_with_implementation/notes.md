# Lecture 10: Operators in C++ with Implementation  

In this lecture, we explored different types of operators in C++ and their rules of evaluation.  

### Key Takeaways:  
1. **BODMAS & Precedence**  
   - C++ follows a strict order of precedence for arithmetic expressions.  
   - Parentheses > Unary operators > Multiplication/Division > Addition/Subtraction.  

2. **Arithmetic Operators**  
   - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
   - Work as expected but follow precedence rules.  

3. **Unary Operators**  
   - `++` (increment), `--` (decrement).  
   - Difference between **pre-increment** (`++i`) and **post-increment** (`i++`).  

4. **Comparison Operators**  
   - `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`  
   - Used for relational comparisons in conditions.  

5. **Logical Operators**  
   - `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).  
   - Commonly used in conditional statements like `if` and `while`.  

6. **Bitwise Operators**  
   - `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT).  
   - Shift operators: `<<` (left shift), `>>` (right shift).  
   - Useful for low-level programming and optimizations.  

7. **Assignment Operators**  
   - `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`  
   - Combine assignment with an operation.  

8. **Operator Precedence & Associativity**  
   - Some operators (like `*` and `/`) have higher precedence than others.  
   - Associativity decides evaluation order when precedence is the same.  

### Real-life Examples in Class:
- Find the **largest of three numbers** using logical operators.  
- Check if a character is a **vowel or consonant**.  
- Demonstrate bitwise shifting for integers.  

This lecture builds the foundation for **decision-making and optimization** in future topics.
